//Create a program that reads in the following list of names from a file called `exercise41_input.txt` and sorts the list alphabetically:
//Create a file called "exercise41_input.txt" with a list of names for testing 
//Create a file called "exercise41_output.txt" that will store the sorted list.
//write a function called name_sorter to sort the names alphabetically
//call the file "exercise41_input.txt" to name_Sorter
// let name_Sorter count the number of elements in the list and alphabetically sort the names.
// send the sorted names to file "exercise41_output.txt"
// print how many names there are and list them.
//done?
//example
/*Ling, Mai
Johnson, Jim
Zarnecki, Sabrina
Jones, Chris
Jones, Aaron
Swift, Geoffrey
Xiong, Fong
Then print the sorted list to a file called `exercise41_output.txt` that looks like the following example output.

Example Output
Total of 7 names
-----------------
Johnson, Jim
Jones, Aaron
Jones, Chris
Ling, Mai
Swift, Geoffrey
Xiong, Fong
Zarnecki, Sabrina

//Constraint
//Don't hard-code the number of names.
